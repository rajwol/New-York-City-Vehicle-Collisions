# New York-City Vehicle Collisions Analysis (2018 - 2024)

## **Project Overview**

This project utilizes data from New York City's Open Data Portal to analyze motor vehicle collisions across the city. The dataset encompasses detailed information about collisions, including:
- Geographic information (boroughs and zip codes)
- Recorded injuries and fatalities
- Contributing factors leading to the collisions

The primary objective is to leverage SQL for data analysis and visualize these insights through an interactive Tableau Dashboard

**Dashboard**: [NYC Vehicle Collisions Dashboard](https://tinyurl.com/NYC-Vehicle-Collisions)

## **Dataset Description**

- **Source**: [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

- **Link To Dataset**: [Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)

- **Timeframe**: Filtered down from 2018 to 2024

- **Records**: ~ 1,000,000 collisions

## **Objectives**

- **Time Analysis**: Identify collision patterns by days of the week and times of the day.

- **Cause Analysis**: Determine the leading contributing factors to collisions.

- **Location Trends**: Explore boroughs and neighborhoods with high collision frequencies to uncover trends.

## **Analysis**

1. **Readmittance rate**: A high readmittance rate (87.68%) indicates a lack of treatment quality and a need for better post-discharge care and follow-up

2. **Uninsured Patients**: The hospital saw 8807 encounters with No Insurance, emphasizing to management on the need to reduce higher costs for uninsured patients.

3. **Discrepancies in Coverage Across Races**: Black (21.88%), Native (15.12%), and Hawaiian (13.62%) populations have signicantly lower coverage proportions, potentially leading to financial strain, increase in debt, and avoidance of necessary medical care across the underrepresented races.

4. **COVID-19 Impacts**: The hospital saw an approximate 15% rise for claim costs in 2020 when compared to 2019, followed by an approximate 11% decrease in the subsequent year. Understanding these trends can help forecast the planning and managing of healthcare resources in the case of a future crisis.

5. **Length of Stay Based On Specific Conditions**: Sepsis (203 hours) and COVID-19 (183 hours) saw the highest average Length of Stay(LOS). By focusing on allocation for both resources and adquate staffing in addition to cost management and process improvements, the hospital can enhance the care provided to patients with severe health conditions while potentially reducing LOS.
