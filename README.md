# New York City Vehicle Collisions Analysis (2018 - 2024)

## **Project Overview**

This project utilizes data from New York City's Open Data Portal to analyze motor vehicle collisions across the city. The dataset encompasses detailed information about collisions, including:
- Geographic information (boroughs and zip codes)
- Recorded injuries and fatalities
- Contributing factors leading to the collisions

The primary objective is to leverage SQL for data analysis and visualize these insights through an interactive Tableau Dashboard

**Dashboard**: [NYC Vehicle Collisions Dashboard](https://tinyurl.com/NYC-Vehicle-Collisions)

## **Dataset Description**

- **Source**: [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/)

- **Link To Dataset**: [Motor Vehicle Collisions](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95/about_data)

- **Timeframe**: Filtered down from 2018 to 2024

- **Records**: ~ 1,000,000 collisions

## **Objectives**

- **Time Analysis**: Identify collision patterns by days of the week and times of the day.

- **Cause Analysis**: Determine the leading contributing factors to collisions.

- **Location Trends**: Explore boroughs and neighborhoods with high collision frequencies to uncover trends.

## **Analysis**

1. **Pay Attention!**: Through all combination of borough and year, driver inattention / distraction was the number one contributing to collisions.

2. **Injuries & Fatalities**: Trends within the data shows that vehicle colisions account for an average of 267 fatalities per year. Furthermore, approximately 40% of all collisions result in an injury.
